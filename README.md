### About this repository:
Hello.

I am currently a Master's in Information Technology student at University of Cincinnati. Welcome to my repository.

While this repository may contain some coursework assignments/projects, it will mainly be for my personal projects. At the moment, there won't be anything grand
and fancy, but I hope that I'm able to display what I can do using Python/Pandas and SQL.
